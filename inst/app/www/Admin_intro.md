# Net Zero Systems Tool Admin

This is the admin version of the tool with map builder functionality enabled.

The dropdowns below allows you to select version of the data to load from the SQL database (NZST-WKG on server-04) into the tool.

Once data has been changed within the tool use the Save Map button with a new name or version to save the new data to the database. This data will not be pushed to live yet but will now appear in the dropdowns.
