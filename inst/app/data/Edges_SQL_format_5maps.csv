1). type of crops - ""Potatoes and other vegetables account for the
majority of water used for irrigation in England and Wales, using
25% and 54% of irrigation water respectively"" [quote from pg. 1 of alternative source 1]

2). climate conditions - ""Intensifying agricultural production
may impact on water availability in times of drought by
increasing the competition for a scarce resource that others
want, and may increase downstream risk in times of flooding
by accelerating flow of water from drained lands upstream."" [section 1.5 pg. 3 of Alternative Source 1]",Medium,
